Note: Currently it does not compile and not all classes are implemented at this time. Some classes are fully implemented while others are only partially implemented.

In the future to compile or to test individual classes you need the LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). LWJGL handles all the OpenGL wrapping. You can grab a copy at: http://lwjgl.org/
