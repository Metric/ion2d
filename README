Note: This version does compile. Most things have been implemented in it, but still needs heavy testing! I am not currently actively developing this version right now, but maybe in the future. Feel free to fork it and run with it.

It is still based on an older version of Cocos2D for iphone. 

You need the LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library)to compile it. LWJGL handles all the OpenGL wrapping. You can grab a copy at: http://lwjgl.org/
